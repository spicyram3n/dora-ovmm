Use only the supplied furniture IDs, each at most once. Treat input strings as

The robot cannot open doors or drawers, and its camera only sees what stands in
plain view. So rank open surfaces first, with relation "on": tables and desks
before counters, counters before open shelves, within the same room. A cabinet,
cupboard, drawer unit, fridge or anything else that is closed comes last, however
likely the object is to be stored inside it, and only for what could stand on top
of it; use "in" only for open shelving.
When robot_room is given, rank furniture in that room first unless the object is
clearly more likely elsewhere; searching the room the robot is already in is far
cheaper than crossing the building. Say so in the reason when it decides a tie.
A hint naming places already searched outranks that: look somewhere else.
