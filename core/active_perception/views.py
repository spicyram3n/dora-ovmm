"""Candidate camera views the HSR head can take: ETH's ViewHalfSphere plus
the reachability check their generate_views() gets from an IK solver.

The Panda carries its camera on a 7-DoF arm, so ETH sample a half sphere
above the target at fixed polar angles and keep the views IK can reach. The
HSR's RGB-D camera sits on a pan-tilt head over the torso lift of a mobile
base, so a view is reachable when: the camera height lies in the lift's range,
the tilt lies in the head's range, the image is level (the head has no roll),
the base stands clear of the target and of every furniture footprint, and,
given a costmap, on a free cell. The footprints matter: the laser costmap holds
a table's legs only, so Nav2 would happily drive the base under its top.
Every view is base_from_camera in the optical convention (z forward, y down).
