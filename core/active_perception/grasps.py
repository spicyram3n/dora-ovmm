"""What the policy's grasp branch plugs into: GraspGenX for grasps and Toyota's
IK service for ETH's reachability check.

active_grasp runs VGN on the TSDF and trac_ik on each grasp. Here GraspGenX
reads the fused surface points, and the HSR's whole-body IK service
(launch/ik_solver.launch.py, core/navigation/base_placement.py) answers
whether some base placement and arm configuration reach the palm pose,
collision-checked against the costmap.
